debag
=====

A douche bag JavaScript console

Just include `debag.js` in your HTML document and use the console API as you would normally.

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!"); // You fail at life. Oh, by the way: Hello, World!
```

Right now debag only informs you that you fail at life, but it can be expanded to say more.
